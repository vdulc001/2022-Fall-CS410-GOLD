Problem

-Decrease in physical bookstores and increase in online bookstores
-Not all book retailers list the same criteria 
   * Type, edition, condition, available for renting, etc.
-Hard to find the lowest overall cost when buying books online
   * Booksellers often tack on additional fees that balloon the total price
   * General increase in shipping and handling costs due to COVID 19
