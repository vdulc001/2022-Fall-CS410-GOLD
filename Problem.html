<h2><b>Problem Statement</b></h2>
<p></p>
There exists no site that allows a user to search for a book based on its type (physical or electronic), edition (hardcover or paperback), and condition (new or used) as well as display its cheapest total cost.
  <p></p>
<h2><b>Problem Characteristics</b></h2>
* Decrease in physical bookstores and increase in online bookstores
  <p></p>
* Not all book retailers list the same criteria 
  <p></p>
    * Type, edition, condition, available for renting, etc.
  <p></p>

  <p></p>
   * Booksellers often tack on additional fees that balloon the total price
  <p></p>
