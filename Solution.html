		<h2>Solution Statement</h2>
		
		<p>Booked is a web-based application that shows users where to purchase a book based on its type, edition, condition, and lowest total cost.</p>

		<h2>Solution Characteristics</h2>
		
		<p>* Booked will save time and money during the book-searching process by laying out the type, edition, condition, and cost for the customer.</p>
	
		<p>* Will be done by database searching and web scraping</p>
		
		<p>* For those who prefer to shop online, they are presented with a link to seller’s website.</p>
		
		<p>* Those that prefer in-person shopping will be presented with bookstore’s address.</p>
		
		<p>* Will introduce user’s to local, independent businesses</p>
		
		<h2>Solution Process Flow</h2>
		
		<p>
			The user enters their desired title into Booked.
			The user must also enter their zip code. Their zip code will also add local bookstore sites to the search.
			Booked saves the title and proceeds to browse prices on book sites -- Amazon, Barnes &amp Noble, local bookstores, etc.
			Booked will proceed to the final checkout page in all of the sites above.
			Each total price will be compared, and the site with the cheapest overall price will be returned to the user.
			Booked returns the report: cheapest online price and the local price, to allow the user an option to buy a book in person.
			In addition, if the local book site happens to contain the cheapest book, the user also has the ability to go to this local store in person.
			In either case -- purchased online or in person -- Booked helps each user save money, when purchasing books.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			For example, the user wants to buy <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i> and lives in Reno, Nevada.
			Booked searches Amazon.com, Thrift Books.com, and Sundance Books (a local bookstore).
			<br>The following prices are a result:
			<ul>
				<li>Amazon: $6.47</li>
				<li>Thrift Books: $12.20</li>
				<li>Sundance Books: $10.89</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		   
		<p>At this point, the user would see the Amazon price and the local price. The user would then decide which price and shopping method they want to pursue -- online or in person.</p>
