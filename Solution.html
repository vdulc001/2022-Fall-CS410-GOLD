Solution
The user enters their desired title into Booked.
The user must also enter their zip code. Their zip code will also add local bookstore sites to the search.
Booked saves the title and proceeds to browse prices on book sites-- Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Local Book Stores, Better World Books, etc.
Booked will proceed to the final check out page in all of the sites above.
Each total price will be compared, and the site with the cheapest net price will be returned to the user.
Booked returns the link with the cheapest net cost of the book, and it is up to the user to buy it or not.
In addition, if the local book site happens to contain the cheapest book, the user also has the ability to go to this local store in person.
In either case -- purchased online or in person -- Booked helps each user save money, when purchasing books.
