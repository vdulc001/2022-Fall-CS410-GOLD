Solution
The user enters their desired title into Booked.
The user must also enter their zip code. Their zip code will also add local bookstore sites to the search.
Booked saves the title and proceeds to browse prices on book sites-- Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Local Book Stores, Better World Books, etc.
Booked will proceed to the final check out page in all of the sites above.
Each total price will be compared, and the site with the cheapest net price will be returned to the user.
Booked returns the report: cheapest online price and the local price, to allow the user an option to buy a book in person.
In addition, if the local book site happens to contain the cheapest book, the user also has the ability to go to this local store in person.
In either case -- purchased online or in person -- Booked helps each user save money, when purchasing books.

For example: User wants to buy green eggs and ham and lives in Reno, Nevada (where I live)
Booked searches: Amazon, Thrift Books.com, and Sundance Books (a local store)
The following prices are a result:
Amazon: $6.47
Thrift Books: $12.20
Local Store: $10.89

At this point, the user would see the Amazon price and the local price. The user would then decide which price and shopping method they want to pursue-- online or in person.
